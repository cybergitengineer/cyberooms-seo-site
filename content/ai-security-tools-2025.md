Buying Checklist

‚Ä¢ Must-have: Zero Trust alignment, API access, meaningful detections (low false positives).
‚Ä¢ Nice-to-have: Native cloud integrations, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, usage-based pricing.

Conclusion

AI-driven security tools are now table stakes. Start with clear 
objectives (reduce dwell time, limit lateral movement) and select a 
platform that integrates with your existing data and controls.",
