## 4. Microsoft Defender/Sentinel — Cloud-Native SIEM/SOAR

- What it does: ML analytics across identities, endpoints, cloud.
- Why it matters: Unified detection + automated playbooks.
- Link: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/

## 5. Darktrace — Self-Learning Anomaly Detection

- What it does: Learns “normal” to detect threats and insiders.
- Why it matters: Catch subtle anomalies early.

## 6. Palo Alto Cortex XDR — Cross-Domain Analytics

## 7. Wiz — Cloud Security Posture + Graph

## 8. Lacework — Cloud Threat Detection

## 9. Akamai Guardicore — Segmentation

## 10. Fortinet (FortiEDR/FortiSIEM) — Integrated Stack

*(For 6–10, mirror the 4 bullets above: What it does / Why it matters / Good for / Link)*

## Buying Checklist

- Must-have: Zero Trust alignment, API access, meaningful detections (low false positives).
- Nice-to-have: Native cloud integrations, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, usage-based pricing.

## Conclusion

AI-driven security tools are now table stakes. Start with clear objectives (reduce dwell time, limit lateral movement) and select a platform that integrates with your existing data and controls.",
